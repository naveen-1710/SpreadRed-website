        <h1>BloodBuddy</h1>
        <p>Blood donation is a noble act that saves lives. Every <span class="highlight">donation</span> can make a difference by providing essential blood components to those in need. Donated blood is used in various medical treatments, surgeries, and emergencies. By donating blood, you can contribute to improving someone's health and even save their life.</p>
        <p>To ensure the safety and effectiveness of blood transfusions, it's important to follow the guidelines provided by blood donation centers. Before donating blood, make sure you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meet the <span class="highlight">eligibility criteria</span> for blood donation, including age, weight, and health conditions.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated and eat a healthy meal before donating blood.</li>
            <li>Inform the staff about any medications or medical conditions you have.</li>
            <li>Rest and avoid strenuous activities after donating blood to prevent dizziness or weakness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By becoming a regular blood donor, you can become someone's <span class="highlight">BloodBuddy</span> and provide lifesaving support to individuals in need. Your generosity can make a significant impact on the lives of patients, families, and communities.</p>
